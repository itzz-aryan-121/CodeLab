# Real-Time Code Collaborator

A web application for real-time code collaboration, enabling multiple users to edit and run code together. This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and allows users to interact with live code sessions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can join a code session and edit the code simultaneously.
- **Code Execution**: Supports running code in various languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, C++) directly from the browser.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Provides syntax highlighting for supported programming languages.
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and login functionality to manage user access to sessions.
- **Session Management**: Users can create, join, and leave code sessions.
- **Live Chat**: In-app chat feature for real-time communication between collaborators.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux (for state management), Socket.io (for real-time communication)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user data and session management)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets (using Socket.io)
- **Code Execution**: Integration with third-party services or custom APIs to run code
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
